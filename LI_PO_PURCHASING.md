# LiPo Purchasing considerations

So a 3.7V LiPo battery is not included as part of this. You need to source your own and this should be done carefully. 

The LiPo connector uses a 2 Pin JST connector. It is very important that you get your battery from a reputable supplier and that the polarity on the 2 Pin JST connector is correct.

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">Make sure the polarity on the JST connector is correct.</p>

Please don't buy cheap batteries from Ebay or AliExpress, buy a brand name battery, like an Adafruit, from an etablished and reputable supplier. 
  
* We reccomend the Adafruit 3.7v 4400mAh battery:

This project is not worth doing if you buy cheap batteries, please don't do it.
