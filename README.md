# PhotonPowerZero

The Photon Power Zero project aims to build an ecosystem of electronics, code, BoM and 3D printable parts that make it as easy as possible to go from a Raspberry Pi Zero proof of concept, sitting on someone's desk, to an outdoor deployment. There is an initial Kickstarter planned, and you can get one of the first boards by checking out the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/packets2photons/photon-power-zero)

You can find the user docs, showing you how to get started with the Photon Power Zero, and the design decisions around the board here:

The project is more than just the Photon Power Zero board. I want to create and share all components to make deploying a Raspberry Pi Zero outdoors as easy as possible.

As an open-source project, you can find the code for the Photon Power Zero and the Raspberry Pi, the Kicad PCB files and the FDM 3D printing files below

Note that the Photon Power Zero does not come with a LiPo battery. You need to self-source your battery and carefully read our [LIPO_PURCHASING](LIPO_PURCHASING.md) guide.

We have tested the solar panels from [Voltaic Systems](https://voltaicsystems.com/). We used the 6-watt 6-volt panels during testing, but the 9-10-watt panels they sell should work even better.
