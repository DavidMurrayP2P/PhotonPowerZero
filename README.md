# PhotonPowerZero

Welcome to the github page of the Photon Power Zero. The goal of this project is to build an ecosystem of electronics, code and parts that make it as easy as possible to go from a Raspberry Pi Zero desk based proof of concept and then deploy this outdoors. 

You can find the user docs, showing you how to get started with the the Photon Power Zero, and the design decisions, around the board here:
* [USERDOCS](USERDOCS.md)
* [DESIGN_DECISIONS](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)
* [LIPO_PURCHASING](LIPO_PURCHASING.md)

The project is more than just the Photon Power Zero board. I want to create and share all of components to make it as easy as possible to deploy a Raspberry Pi Zero outdoors.

This is an open source project and so you can find the code for the Photon Power Zero and the Raspberry Pi, the kicad PCB files and the FDM 3D printing files below

Note that the Photon Power Zero does not come with a LiPo battery. You need to self source this and you should carefully read our [LIPO_PURCHASING](LIPO_PURCHASING.md) guide.
