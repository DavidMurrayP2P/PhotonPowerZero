# PhotonPowerZero

Welcome to the github page of the Photon Power Zero. The goal of this project is to build an ecosystem of electronics, code and parts that make it as easy as possible to go from a Raspberry Pi Zero desk based proof of concept and then deploy this outdoors. 

Youtube vid summarising idea using the outdoor thing as a thumbnail.

You can find the userdocumentation, showing you how to get started with the the Photono power Zero, and the design decisions, around the board here:
* [README](README.md)
* [DESIGN_DECISIONS](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)

The project is more than just the Photon Power Zero board. I want to create and share all of components to make it as easy as possible to deploy a Raspberry Pi Zero outdoors.
