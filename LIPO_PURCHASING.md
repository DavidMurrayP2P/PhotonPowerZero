# LiPo Purchasing considerations

A single cell 3.7V LiPo battery must be sourced and this should be done carefully. I have had success with 4400mAH as a capacity for the Raspberry Pi Zero. 

You must only buy from a trusted supplier such as Adafruit, Core Electronics, Little Bird, Pimoroni. DO NOT buy LiPo from ebay or ali express vendors.

Many vendors may reverse the polarity of their LiPo Batteries. Do not take any risks or shortcuts here.

The LiPo connector uses a 2 Pin JST connector. It is very important that you get your battery from a reputable supplier and that the polarity on the 2 Pin JST connector is correct.

This project is not worth doing if you buy cheap batteries, please don't do it.
